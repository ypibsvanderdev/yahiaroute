/**
 * check-install-upgrade — proves the two install paths a real user takes, BEFORE publishing.
 *
 * `check:pack-boot` already proves a fresh install boots. It does NOT prove the path that
 * actually broke us: installing the new version OVER an existing one, where ~110 SQLite
 * migrations run against a populated database. v3.8.48 shipped as a hotfix precisely because
 * the published 3.8.47 crashed on boot, and a v3.8.49 manual test on a real 3.8.48 box was
 * what first exercised the upgrade path end to end.
 *
 * Phase A — clean install:   fresh prefix + fresh DATA_DIR, install the packed tarball, boot.
 * Phase B — upgrade install: fresh prefix + fresh DATA_DIR, install the PREVIOUS published
 *                            version, boot it (creates + migrates the DB), stop, install the
 *                            packed tarball over the SAME prefix, boot against the SAME DATA_DIR.
 *
 * Schema convergence is the third assertion, and its DIRECTION is what matters:
 *
 *   fresh − upgraded ≠ ∅  →  FAIL. A table a clean install creates but an upgrade does not
 *                            means every existing user is missing structure the code expects.
 *                            This is the failure mode that only ever bites upgraders.
 *   upgraded − fresh ≠ ∅  →  WARN. Residue: a table whose CREATE left the migration set in
 *                            some past cycle but survives in databases that already had it.
 *                            Harmless, but it means the two paths do not converge — allowlist
 *                            it explicitly so a NEW divergence is still visible.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check/check-install-upgrade.mjs [--from <version>] [--skip-upgrade]
 *
 * `--from` pins the previous version (default: the current `latest` dist-tag on npm).
 * Requires `npm run build:cli` first — this is a --with-build gate, like check:pack-boot.
