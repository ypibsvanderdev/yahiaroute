/**
 * Insert `value` at the caret of an already-resolved ChatGPT composer, returning whether the edit
 * was applied. Runs inside the page, so it may reference only globals and its two arguments.
 *
 * Effort selection closes a menu immediately before a staged part is attached, and focus is still
 * settling when this runs: the composer can be the active element while the caret has not yet been
 * placed inside it, or focus can still be on the menu that just closed. Reading that as a rejected
 * edit failed whole turns roughly a tenth of a second after the effort menu closed, so the caret is
 * placed explicitly instead of assumed. An existing collapsed caret inside the composer is left
 * exactly where the user put it; only a missing or foreign one is replaced, and always with a
 * position inside this composer, so an insert can never land in another element.
