/**
 * #11804 — the combo loop-safety timer must be cleared on EVERY exit path.
 *
 * `dispatchWithCooldownRetry` (open-sse/services/combo.ts) arms a
 * `setTimeout(..., loopSafetyMs)` — 10 minutes by default — once per `setTry`
 * iteration, so a combo that never produces a terminal response still answers
 * the client with a 504 instead of hanging forever.
 *
 * Before this fix the only `clearTimeout` lived inside the `if (anySuccess)`
 * branch (the code comment said so verbatim: "clear the safety timer on the
 * happy path"). Every error exit — all_targets_skipped, all_accounts_inactive,
 * the aggregated-status return, the final fallback, the global-timeout branch —
 * returned the response to the client and left a 600s timer pending, its
 * closure retaining `orderedTargets` and the exhausted provider/connection
 * sets. Field evidence on the issue: a client received 502 immediately and the
 * "Combo loop safety timeout ... force-terminating" line was logged exactly
 * 600s later, long after the request was gone.
 *
 * This is a source-level guard rather than a runtime one: driving a real combo
 * through each terminal branch needs the full provider/credential/DB stack, and
 * the invariant we actually care about ("no exit path may skip the clear") is a
 * structural property of the function. The guard fails if someone reintroduces
 * a happy-path-only clear or drops the finally.
