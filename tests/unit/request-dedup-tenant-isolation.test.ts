// therefore one response object — between every concurrent caller landing on the
// same hash. The hash canonicalized model + prompt + sampling params and nothing
// about WHO was asking, so two distinct OmniRoute API keys issuing the same
// request joined the same in-flight promise: the response was produced with the
// initiator's provider connection, under the initiator's per-key policy, and
// handed to a different authenticated principal.
//
// #10438 fixed the *prompt* half of this class (translated bodies hashing the
// prompt as `null`). This is the *identity* half.
