# Free Tiers Guide: Understand and Combine Free AI Access

> **TL;DR**: OmniRoute registers 352 provider IDs, with **152 provider-catalog entries marked `hasFree`**. The stricter audited free-model catalog covers **34 recurring pool keys / 444 entries** (437 active + 7 discontinued). Connect several suitable providers for broader fallback capacity; every quota, approval rule, privacy policy, and paid-overage condition still applies.

## What Are Free Tiers?

Many AI providers offer some form of **free access**. Depending on the provider, that may
mean a no-auth endpoint, recurring quota, rate-limited uncapped access, a signup grant,
manual approval, or a temporary promotion. Some options require an account, API key,
credit card, KYC, or acceptance of provider-specific terms.

OmniRoute **aggregates** these free tiers into one endpoint. Instead of signing up for 10 different services, you connect them all to OmniRoute and use `model: "auto"` to automatically pick the best free option for each request.

## Representative Free-Access Providers

### Recurring, Keyless, or Uncapped Access

These providers have a recurring, keyless, or uncapped free-access path in the audited catalog. “Uncapped” means no published token cap; rate, concurrency, account, regional, and policy limits can still apply:

| Provider          | Models                                                                         | Quota                                                                                                            | How to Connect                                                                           |

### Signup Grants and Provider-Specific Credits

These providers give you **free credits** when you sign up:

| Provider      | Free Credits                                                       | Models                    | How to Get                                                |

## How to Stack Free Tiers

The magic of OmniRoute is **stacking free tiers**. Instead of relying on one provider, you connect multiple free providers and let OmniRoute automatically pick the best one for each request.

### Example: Broader Free-Tier Coverage

Connect several providers to reduce dependence on any single quota:

1. **Gemini** — recurring API-key quota
2. **Groq** — recurring API-key quota
3. **Pollinations** — keyless, rate-limited access
4. **LongCat** — one-time signup grant (requires KYC)

Then use `model: "auto"` and OmniRoute will:

- Try the highest-ranked eligible connection first
- If its quota or health check fails → try the next configured provider
- If the keyless provider is unavailable → continue through the remaining targets
- If all fail → use LongCat as backup

**Result**: broader free-tier coverage with automatic fallback — not a guarantee of unlimited capacity.

---

## How to Connect Free Providers

### Step 1: Open the Dashboard

Go to `http://localhost:20128` in your browser.

### Step 2: Go to Providers

Click **Providers** in the sidebar.

### Step 3: Click Add Provider

Click the **+ Add Provider** button.

### Step 4: Select a Free Provider

Browse the catalog and inspect each provider's current `hasFree`, auth, quota, privacy,
and ToS metadata. The provider card and the
[Free Tiers Reference](../reference/FREE_TIERS.md) distinguish recurring pools,
uncapped/keyless access, signup credits, discontinued entries, and higher-risk sources.

### Step 5: Click Connect

For a `NOAUTH` provider, no credential is required. OAuth and API-key providers must be
connected through their documented account flow.

### Step 6: Repeat

Connect several providers whose terms and privacy model fit your use case.

---

## Reading the Catalog Correctly

- `NOAUTH` means OmniRoute does not ask you for a provider credential; it does not
  guarantee uptime, privacy, or unlimited capacity.
- `hasFree` is discovery metadata. It can represent a recurring quota, keyless access,
  signup credit, approval program, or promotion.
- `recurring-uncapped` means no published token ceiling was available; rate and
  concurrency limits still apply.
- `one-time-initial` does not recur after the signup grant is consumed.
- `tos: avoid` is a warning to review provider terms and account risk before use.
- Entries marked `discontinued` remain historical evidence and must not be presented as
  currently free.

## How OmniRoute Makes Free Tiers Better

### 1. Automatic Fallback

If one free provider is busy or down, OmniRoute automatically tries the next one. You don't need to do anything.

### 2. Smart Routing

OmniRoute picks the **best free provider** for each request based on:

- Speed — Which provider is fastest right now?
- Quality — Which provider is best for this task?
- Capacity — Which provider has quota remaining?

### 3. Token Savings

OmniRoute's compression pipeline can reduce eligible prompt and tool-output tokens. The
actual savings depend on content, selected engines, provider accounting, and fidelity
settings; compression does not multiply every provider quota by a fixed amount.

### 4. Multi-Account Support

If provider terms permit multiple accounts or credentials, OmniRoute can treat each
connection as a separate routing candidate. Do not create extra accounts to evade a
provider's quota or access policy.

## Free Tier Math

The live, pool-deduplicated catalog currently reports:

| Metric                                               |                            Current audited value | Interpretation                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recurring quantified grant                           |                          **~1.47B tokens/month** | Shared pools counted once; excludes uncapped providers from the sum                                                        |
| First month with signup grants                       |                                **~2.10B tokens** | Recurring total plus one-time and recurring credits                                                                        |
| Audited free-model inventory                         | **34 recurring pool keys / 444 catalog entries** | 437 active + 7 discontinued; distinct from the 352-provider catalog                                                        |
| Recurring/keyless free-forever providers represented |                                           **52** | Unique providers across recurring daily/monthly/credit/uncapped and keyless catalog types, eligibility-gated rows excluded |
| Provider catalog entries marked `hasFree`            |                                    **152 / 352** | Broader provider metadata; not all have a quantifiable recurring quota                                                     |

These values are computed from `open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.ts`; see the
[Free Tiers Reference](../reference/FREE_TIERS.md) for pool deduplication, ToS flags,
discontinued entries, and signup-credit methodology.

## Common Questions

### "Is this really free?"

The catalog records provider-published terms and project research, but offers can change.
Verify the provider's current pricing, quota, privacy policy, and eligibility before use.

### "Will the free tier run out?"

Every provider can rate-limit, change models, suspend access, or go offline. Multiple
connections improve fallback coverage but do not guarantee an available free route.

### "Can I use free providers for production?"

Only if the provider's SLA, data handling, limits, and terms meet your production
requirements. Critical workloads should have monitored, contractually suitable fallback.

### "What's the catch?"

Tradeoffs may include strict limits, waitlists, KYC, credit-card verification, training on
prompts, weaker privacy, no SLA, model churn, geographic restrictions, paid overage, or
account-policy risk. OmniRoute surfaces the available metadata; you choose what to enable.

### "How do I get more free quota?"

1. Connect more free providers
2. Enable appropriate compression engines and measure savings for your workload
3. Use `auto/cheap` to prioritize free/cheap providers
4. Add additional permitted providers or credentials without violating provider terms

### "Do free providers have worse quality?"

Not necessarily. Some providers expose the same model families available through paid
routes, but limits, latency, privacy, reliability, and model versions can differ. Use the
Free Provider Rankings page as a quality signal and verify the actual model served.
